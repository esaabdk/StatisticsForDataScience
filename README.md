Blockchain has recently gained momentum. As one of its first implementations,
bitcoin as a cryptocurrency has gained a lot of attention. Together with Ethereum,
blockchain implementation with focus on smart contracts, they represent the very
core of modern cryptocurrency development. This project is focused on some data
analysis in Ethereum and its price datasets like nding discrete distribution type
of how many times a user buys/sells a token, extracting features on the ethereum
transaction dataset and finding its correlation with price dataset, creating a multiple
linear regression model to compute the price on day t by extracting some features on
day t-1 from the datasets.
